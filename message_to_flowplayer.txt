Some FLV/SorensonSpark/MP3 files do not play properly
=====================================================

This particular file, encoded with ffmpeg Mac GUI version, doesn't play initially when used with FlowPlayer.

The odd thing is that if you pause the player, and then press the play button again, the picture actually appears.

I'm using version 3.2.7 of FlowPlayer on Firefox 9 on Windows 7.

You can git clone a test repo from this address:

Hope you'll be able to fix this problem soon.
